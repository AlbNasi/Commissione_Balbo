Here we list the future updates we are currently working on.
It is divided in three parts. In the first one we list the short term updates (projects we are currently working on). In the second one we list the future steps (medium term projects which complement the short term ones or are the first steps toward the dreams). In the third ones we list the dreams, where we list future long term objectives.

Short term
1) Finish updating the 'province' tag in the 1994, 1996 and 2001 elections.
2) Start approaching the Senate data
3) Provide data for affluence

Future steps
1) Set an additional data set for tracking party changes in Italy. As it is common in Italy for parties to change names, in particular after the end of the so called 'First Republic', this would help track the parties pongitudinally.
2) Set an additional data set for tracking individual towns or provinces. Taking into account possible institutional changes makes it possible to track geographical areas longitudinally.
3) Find a way to take into account candidates for the first-past-the-post seats in the elections of 1994, 1996 and 2001. As it was possible to split the vote between the proportional consitutency and the uninominal one, this is much more complicated than it sounds.

Dreams
1) Expand the same process to administrative and europeans elections.
2) Expand the process to other countries where it is possible for me to understand the language (first candidates would be France or the UK)
3) Expand the process to Kingdom of Italy's elections (would need feet on the ground work and possibly the help of an historian).
