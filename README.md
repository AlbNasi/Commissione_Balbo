# Commissione Balbo
This projects aims at recording a comprehensive dataset of the Italian elections at a municipal level. All of the data is available as a raw format through the Italian Ministry of the Interior at https://dait.interno.gov.it/elezioni

For now we are still working at cleaning up the data for the Italian Lower Chamber (Camera dei Deputati). In particular we have to deal with the absence of a 'Province' tag for the towns for the 1994, 1996 and 2001 elections, when the Mattarella electoral law was in force (also known as 'Mattarellum'). The process is tedious as several provinces were reorganized during those years and it is necessary to identify the correct tag per election. Hopefully we will start soon to compile the data for the Upper Chamber (Senato). For future updates refer to the wiki.
