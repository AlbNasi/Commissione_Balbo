# Commissione Balbo
This projects aims at recording a comprehensive dataset of the Italian elections at a municipal level. All of the data is available as a raw format through the Italian Ministry of the Interior at https://dait.interno.gov.it/elezioni

We have uploaded most of the data of the individual elections for both chambers of the Italian Parliament (Only the 2018 Senate data is missing). What we are working on now is to solve the main mismatch in the adminstrative tags. For further details refer to the wiki.
